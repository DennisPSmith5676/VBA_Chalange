Before You Begin coding 

1. Create a new repository for this project called `VBA-challenge`. Do not add this homework to an existing repository. -Done see GitHub

2. Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.-Done see GitHub

Files needed

 [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

 [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.


Stock market analyst Instructions

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

1. The ticker symbol. - Done see Ticker.vba

2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.- Done see Ticker.vba

3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.- Done see Ticker.vba

4. The total stock volume of the stock.- Done see Ticker.vba

5. You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.- Done see Ticker.vba (note this was the hardwst for me)

6. The result should look as follows. - Done ties to 2014


BONUS

Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the following
1. "Greatest % increase"- Done see Ticker.vba
2. "Greatest % decrease" - Done see Ticker.vba
3. "Greatest total volume” - Done see Ticker.vba

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.- Done see Ticker.vba

Other Considerations

 Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

 Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.


Submission

To submit please upload the following to Github:

1. A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.  -done see git hub

2. VBA Scripts as separate files.- Done see Ticker.vba (only 1 file)

3. Ensure you commit regularly to your repository and it contains a README.md file. - Done but i am sorry did most of this in VBA will try harder next time.

4. After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>. - Done See Boot Camp Spot
